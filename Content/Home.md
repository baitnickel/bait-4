Sorry, there's nothing too entertaining or exciting on this site yet. Probably someday ... maybe. For the most part, the pages are for my own benefit. I've written every line of code myself—reinventing the wheel at every turn because coding is fun. I'm not using any libraries, apart from those included in plain ole Javascript and supported by virtually all modern browsers. I've written my own Markdown and YAML parsers, tailored to my needs. Each menu item opens a page that is a bit like a little app (what we in the computer science world used to call an *application*). These are primitive demos, however—my focus has not been on the user interface—I'm primarily working on site infrastructure, pursuing grand design ideas.

I think what I am trying to do is create a site on which I can share interesting things in my world—personal history, philosophy, photography, audio, video, &c. Someday after I'm gone, someone will go through my things, sorting out the trash from the curiosities. I have writing going back to my childhood—little notepad diaries becoming bigger notepad diaries becoming computer files. I have audio too—songs we, as teenagers, wrote and sang into a monaural reel-to-reel tape recorder, songs I wrote and sang for my children, music I've made in the modern home studio era. I have too many photos spanning most of my life, home movies... the list goes on and on. Would that I could post it all!

Anyway, you might find a few of the demo pages interesting. I'm quite proud of the code underneath *Songs* and *I Ching*. The display of the song sheets, in particular, is quite clever if I do say so myself—grab a guitar and check out the transpose (key change) feature.
