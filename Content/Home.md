Sorry, there's nothing too entertaining or exciting on this site yet. Probably someday ... maybe. For the most part, the pages are for my own benefit. I've written every line of code myself—reinventing the wheel at every turn because coding is fun. I'm not using any platforms or libraries, apart from those included in plain Javascript and supported by virtually all modern browsers. I've written my own Markdown and YAML parsers, tailored to my needs. Each menu item opens a page that is a bit like a little application. These are simple demos, however—my focus has not been on the user interface—I'm primarily working on site infrastructure and pursuing a few design ideas. Maybe what I'm trying to do is create a kind of multimedia blog.

I'm writing text content in the Obsidian app and coding in TypeScript (which generates JavaScript), using the VSCode editor.

Anyway, you might find a few of the demo pages interesting. I'm quite proud of the code underneath *Songs* and *I Ching*. The display of the song sheets, in particular, is quite clever, if I do say so myself, supporting key transposition and chord diagrams rendered dynamically from simple notations such as: `C x32010`.
