Perfectly flat, perfectly straight, perfectly aligned east to west, perfectly measured out lots, each one 22 yards by 55 yards (exactly one quarter acre), one by one adding up to 440 yards on each side of the street forming a perfect quarter mile. Right in the middle on the northern side sat the yellow house that Wesley and Averyl bought, the house they raised their four boys in.

In the summertime, they'd sleep under the southern skies on the backyard brick patio, dreaming into the stars, waking to the morning sun. Parent to child, stories were shared. Stories of how the stars shine, how we turn to face them moment by moment. Myths of the past illuminated, visions of the future imagined, but mostly sounds and sights of the present shared and observed.

(4840 square yards in an acre. A quarter acre is 1210 square yards. So properties that are 22 yards wide would be 55 yards deep if the property is .25 acres, which Dad alway said. Square footage is 66 x 165 = 10,890).
