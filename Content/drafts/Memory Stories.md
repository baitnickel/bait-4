When I think about my earliest memory I usually think about the evening in San Jose, helping my family lay bricks near the back step of our yellow house. I scurried around the little picket fence behind which lay the sandbox Dad made for us. Scooping up a bucket of sand, I scurried back around the fence and delivered the sand to the bricks' sand bed.

Truth be told, I really only remember the story about the memory. I must have been about nine or ten years old, sitting in my place at the dinner table, my parents and three brothers forming a circle, talking as we usually did in the way we always talked, as a family. The subject of earliest memories must have come up. I reported the memory as I've told it above. My parents expressed some surprise at how young I must have been—not quite three years old, as I recall. As so, this memory was corroborated and dated. Henceforth, no other memory could dethrone it. It does seem a shame, though, that such a treasured memory should been completely gone. Tired little memory cells flushed from my mind.

It is a vivid example of impermanence, I suppose. Memories flow away like the colors on our retinas—not quite as fast, it seems, but just as steady. Perhaps the eyes look inside too, streaming colors into colonies of memory cells. Perhaps the flow is like a river run into its sea, the connection there as long as the water's moving.
