"With your full mind you form the mudra in your hands." ~ Shunryū Suzuki

Meditation can be a constant struggle. I sit in meditation more these days than ever before—at least this is true of my cerebral days, the days since I was a child without memories, without language. The most satisfying meditation is the one where all words and concepts vanish, leaving only this body breathing on the surface of this planet spinning in its orbit around this star so bright in this moment. But this can be hard to achieve.

There was the time on the front lawn of the Lindaire house, a moment I can barely recollect anymore—I've revisited the memory too many times, worn out the hinges, cannot see it as I once could, cannot feel it anymore. All I know is I was sitting in the glow of a warm summer morning, the street was silent, the still air laden with the scent of the strawberry field behind the houses across the street.

There was the time on the back patio of the Noranda apartment, having sunk low in the sadness of the room inside, now feeling the glow of the life within the vibrant coals in the hibachi.

The interesting thing about life is that it is all around us, all the time. One need only pause to feel it now and then. It's not going anywhere. Scientists debate the age of the earth—when did it start, when will it end? There is absolutely no evidence of anything other than this eternal now, ever changing.
