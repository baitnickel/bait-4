It seems I've always known about Einstein. I must have heard his name on television. Maybe in a cartoon. When we were children in the playground at school, most of us playing kickball or basketball or dodgeball, while a few of the class weirdos would be sitting on a bench reading a book. "What a weirdo. Hey Einstein, you're such a weirdo." It was very clear to us that Einstein, the actual man, was a genius, but then we only knew it as an insulting name.

I managed to get all the way through school without learning the significance of Einstein's visions. Maybe there was a chapter in a history book in the later grammar school years where Einstein was mentioned as a physics genius who made some great discoveries, but I don't remember anyone talking about what these discoveries were.

In my junior and senior college prep years, I studied chemistry and physics. I didn't do well in either course. I certainly may have missed something, but I don't recall any discussion of quarks or spacetime. Einstein's world had established post-Newtonian physics, demonstrated in the Manhattan Project and other technologies. But no one was talking about it.

I imagine if I'd studied any physics at Berkeley I would have learned something relevant. But I started there as a junior and was done in two years. There was time for a a few electives, but I'd been sufficiently soured by my prep school physics. The last thing I wanted was to hear more about force and velocity and potential energy. Instead I chose Beethoven and Descartes and Lewis Carroll.

Spacetime ... I remember where I was sitting, on a bench during lunchtime at school when I was about 9 or 10 years old. I had a little epiphany about Time—oh, *that's* what Time is, I thought. I think it cemented a certain belief about Time and I can only guess what I may have believed previously—it's lost now. But I wonder if it may have been closer to the way I envision Time now.

The Time ruts reflect the motion of our experience—the earth spinning round and round, rolling around the sun in its orbit, carried with the rest of the galaxy in its rotation, expanding into the spacetime created by the Big Bang. If it were all to stop suddenly, would there be no more Time?
