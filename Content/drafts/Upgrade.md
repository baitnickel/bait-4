Laurel's laptop was showing signs of old age. The outer case was falling apart a little. Some of the letters on the keyboard buttons were impossible to read. Fortunately, she's a touch typist. I'd be hunting and hunting and hunting before I could finally peck. But the main problem was the battery.

The genius at the store ran some diagnostics on it and confirmed the battery was more than just old—it was defective. For a couple hundred dollars, they could do a battery replacement. Or, the genius suggested, we might think about giving the old machine a proper burial and replacing it with one of the shiny new thousand dollar models on the other side of the store. It was tempting. Maybe it is time to say goodbye to Old Yeller.

The less-expensive option seemed the right one. New machines are nice, but the old one's got a certain je ne sais quoi. It just needs a boost. Remember when we just popped new batteries into a device and then it was good to go?

The genius agreed with us. But of course, he said, it will take several days to get the parts and several days to do the repairs, and just opening the sealed case of your beloved is likely to break something which could lead to further delays. Yeah, yeah, said we.

About a month later Laurel received a message. Your computer is ready for pickup, it said. Laurel was sure that this would be another false alarm, after we'd been summoned a couple of times before only to find that something else was wrong or that it hadn't been properly diagnosed. "This is not going to turn out well," she said, "I just know it." And, in fact, when the genius delivered the machine, it became clear pretty quickly that the little machine was not well. "How do we get through this startup screen?" we asked. It slowly became clear that the old data was all gone. The machine had been given a lobotomy. The genius said, we told you we had to replace the logic board. From this, we were apparently meant to understand that the storage device had been trashed. Our bad.

Okay, fine. Good thing we have a backup. "We're not leaving the store until we can demonstrate to ourselves that everything's been fixed," said Laurel. "Of course, said the genius. I'm all yours."

Things looked more or less normal as the familiar system screens began to come up. Laurel had to redefine her user profile—it was a peculiar affront, having the machine forget who she was like that. But the little icons we know finally appeared, and we opened a web browser to make sure videos looked and sounded good. "Of course," said the genius. "It passed all the diagnostic tests."

Curious, though, the way YouTube came up, but only the frames of the videos could be seen. No graphics, really. Oh sure, a grid of empty gray borders *reminds* me of YouTube—but where's the pretty colorful images and the stereo music we've come to expect? Why doesn't the site respond to clicks?

The genius offered a series of theories. "Maybe the store's free Wi-Fi is slow today." Really, really slow. Or "maybe we should connect your machine to some power." Or "maybe we should connect an ethernet cable." Or "maybe I should go talk to my manager"....

"Okay, here's the deal," said the genius. "One option—you can have one of those shiny new thousand dollar models for free, or"....

I honestly can't remember the other options the genius offered. But that's how Laurel ended up with a nice new free laptop.
