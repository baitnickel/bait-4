When I arrived at the west entrance of [Yosemite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosemite_National_Park) I came to a slow stop behind a short line of cars making their way through the ranger kiosk. I'd been driving nonstop for hours—it was strange to suddenly sit still. Finally I could take it all in—Yosemite in the winter is something to see, and I was seeing it for the first time. New snow had fallen on the park just a day or two earlier. I could tell it had been a quiet steady storm—the trees were dusted with snow in perfect layers. 

When I looked in the rear view mirror, I was surprised to find that Anne and Ed were right behind me. We had set out independently from different cities and somehow arrived uncoordinated at the very same time.

The ranger in the kiosk was cheerful and alert and sent me through the entrance gate saying, "It's beautiful in there." Indeed it was. One of the most beautiful sites I've ever seen.
