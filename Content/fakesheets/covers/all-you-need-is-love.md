^ There's nothing you can ^do that can't be ^done 
^ And nothing you can ^sing that can't be ^sung 
^ Nothing you can ^say, but you can ^learn how to play the game--
And it's easy

^ Nothing you can ^make that can't be ^made 
^ No one you can ^save that can't be ^saved 
^ Nothing you can ^do, but you can ^learn (how) to be you in time--
It's easy

   ^ All you ^need is ^love, 		^ all you ^need is ^love 
   ^ All you ^need is ^love, 		^love, ^ love is ^all you need^

There's nothin' you can know that isn't known
And nothing you can see that isn't shown
There's nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be--
It's easy

   ^ All you ^need is ^love, ^ all you ^need is ^love 
   ^ All you ^need is ^love, ^love, ^ love is ^all you need^
