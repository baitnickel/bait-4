.chorus C G C Fm C Fm G A E A Dm A Dm E
  ^Hey ^Bungalow ^Bill, ^what did you ^kill, ^Bungalow ^Bill?
  ^Hey ^Bungalow ^Bill, ^what did you ^kill, ^Bungalow ^Bill?

.verse Am C F G Am C F G E G Am Fm
He ^went out tiger ^hunting with his ^elephant and gun ^
^ In case of ^accident he ^always took his mom ^
He’s the ^all-American, ^bullet-headed, ^saxon mother’s ^son 

All the children sing...  (Chorus)

.verse
^ Deep in the ^jungle where the ^mighty tiger lies ^
^ Bill and his ^elephants were ^taken by surprise ^
^ So Captain ^Marvel zapped him ^right between the ^eyes 

All the children sing...  (Chorus)

.verse
^ The children ^asked him if to ^kill was not a sin ^
^ “Not when he ^looked so fierce,” his ^mommy butted in ^
^ If looks could ^kill it would have been ^us instead of ^him 

All the children sing...  (Chorus repeated)
