^I wanna go all over the world, and start living ^free 
I know that there's somebody who is waiting for ^me 
I'll build a boat, steady and true; as soon as it's ^done 
^I'm gonna ^sail al^ong in a ^dream of my ^dear ^some^one  ^ 

.v2 C G7 C Fm F D9 C A7 D9 G7 Am A7
^One little star smiling tonight knows where you ^are 
Stay little star, steady and bright, to guide me a^far 
Rush little wind over the deep, for now I've be^gun 
^Hurry and ^take me straight ^into the ^arms of my ^dear ^some^one ^ 

.coda F D9 C A7 D9 G7 C
