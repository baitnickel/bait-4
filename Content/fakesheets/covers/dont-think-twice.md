Well, it ^ain't no use to ^sit and wonder ^why, babe
^  If'n you don't know by ^now 
And it ^ain't no use to ^sit and wonder ^why, babe
^  It'll never do, some^how 
When your ^rooster crows at the ^  break of dawn
^  Look out your window and ^  I'll be gone
^  You're the ^reason I'm ^ a'travelin' ^on 
But ^don't think ^twice, it's all ^right  ^ 

And it ^ain't no use in a^'turnin' on your ^light, babe
The ^light I never ^knowed 
And it ^ain't no use in ^turnin' on your ^light, babe
^  I'm on the dark side of the ^road 
But I ^wish there was somethin' you would ^  do or say
^  To try 'n' make me change my ^ mind and stay
^  But we never ^did too much ^talkin' any^way 
But ^don't think ^twice, it's all ^right  ^

Well, it ^ain't no use in ^callin' out my ^name, gal
^  Like you never done be^fore 
And it ^ain't no use in ^callin' out my ^name, gal
^  I can't hear ya any^more 
I'm a^'thinkin' and a'wonderin', ^walkin' down the road
I ^once loved a woman, a ^  child I am told
I ^give her my ^heart, but she ^wanted my ^soul 
But ^don't think ^twice, it's all ^right  ^

So ^lon^g, honey ^babe 
Where I'm ^bound I can't ^tell 
^Goodbye is ^too good a ^word, babe
^  So I'll just say, fare thee ^well 
^I ain't a'sayin' you treated ^  me unkind
You ^coulda done better, but ^  I don't mind
^  You just kinda ^wasted my ^  precious ^time 
^Don't think ^twice, it's all ^right
