^  Untie me I've said no vows
the train is getting way too loud
I've got to ^leave here my girl
and get on with my lo^nely life
just leave the ^ring on the rail
for the wheels to nulli^fy 

^  until this turn in my head
I let you stay and you paid no rent
I spent ^twelve longs months on the la^m 
that's enough ^sitting on the fence
for the fear of breaking ^dams 

.b Am C F C G Am C F C G C G C G F
^  I find a ^fatal flaw in the ^logic of love
and go ^out of my hea^d
^  you love a ^sinking stone
that'll ^never elope
so get ^used to the lon^esome girl
^you must ato^ne some
don't ^leave me no pho^ne number ^there

^  It took me all of a year
to put the poisoned pill to your ear
but now I ^stand on honest ground on hone^st ground
you want to ^fight for this love
but honey you ^cannot wrestle a dove
so baby it's cl^ear 

.b2 Am C F C G Am C F C G
^  You want to ^jump and dance
but you ^sat on your hands
and lost y^our only ch^ance
^  go back to ^your hometown
get your ^feet on the ground
and stop ^floating aro^und
