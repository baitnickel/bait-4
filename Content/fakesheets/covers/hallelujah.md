Now, I've ^heard there was a ^secret chord, that ^David played and it ^pleased the lord
But ^you don't really care for ^music, ^do ya? ^ 
It ^goes like this: the ^fourth, the ^fifth, the ^minor fall, the ^major lift
The ^baffled king com^posing Halle^lujah 

Halle^lujah, Halle^lujah, Halle^lujah, Halle^l^u^jah... ^ ^ ^

Your ^faith was strong but you ^needed proof, you ^saw her bathing ^on the roof
Her ^beauty and the moonlight ^over^threw ya ^
She ^tied you to her ^kitchen ^chair, she ^broke your throne and she ^cut your hair
And ^from your lips she ^drew the ^Hallelujah 

Halle^lujah, Halle^lujah, Halle^lujah, Halle^l^u^jah... ^ ^ ^

Well, ^baby, I've been ^here before, I've ^seen this room and I've ^walked this floor
(You know) I ^used to live alone be^fore I ^knew ya ^
And I've ^seen your flag on the ^marble ^arch, and ^love is not a ^victory march
It's a ^cold and it's a ^broken Halle^lujah 

Halle^lujah, Halle^lujah, Halle^lujah, Halle^l^u^jah... ^ ^ ^

Well, there ^was a time when you ^let me know, what's ^really going ^on below
But ^now you never show that ^to me, ^do ya? ^
But re^member when I ^moved in ^you, and the ^holy dove was ^moving too
And ^every breath we ^drew was Halle^lujah 

Halle^lujah, Halle^lujah, Halle^lujah, Halle^l^u^jah... ^ ^ ^

^Maybe there's a ^god above, but ^all I've ever ^learned from love
Was ^how to shoot somebody ^who out^drew ya ^
And it's ^not a cry that you ^hear at ^night, it's ^not somebody who's ^seen the light
It's a ^cold and it's a ^broken Halle^lujah 

Halle^lujah, Halle^lujah, Halle^lujah, Halle^l^u^jah... ^ ^ ^

You ^say I took the ^name in vain, ^I don't even ^know the name
But ^if I did, well really, ^what's it ^to ya? ^
There's a ^blaze of light in ^every ^word, it ^doesn't matter ^which you heard
The ^holy or the ^broken Halle^lujah 

Halle^lujah, Halle^lujah, Halle^lujah, Halle^l^u^jah... ^ ^ ^

I ^did my best, it ^wasn't much, I ^couldn't feel so I ^tried to touch
I've ^told the truth, I didn't ^come to ^fool ya ^
And ^even though it ^all went ^wrong, I'll ^stand before the ^lord of song
With ^nothing on my ^tongue but Halle^lujah 

Halle^lujah, Halle^lujah, Halle^lujah, Halle^l^u^jah... ^ ^ ^
