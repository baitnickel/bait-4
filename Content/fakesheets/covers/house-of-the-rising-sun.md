There ^is a ^house down in ^New Or^leans 
They ^call the ^Rising ^Sun 
And it's ^been the ^ruin of ^many a poor ^girl 
And ^me, oh ^god, I'm ^one ^

My ^mother ^was a tai^lor ^
She ^sewed these ^new blue ^jeans 
My ^sweetheart ^was a ^gambler, lord^
^Down in ^New Orleans^ ^

Now the ^only ^thing a ^gambler needs^
Is a ^suitcase ^and a trunk^
And the ^only ^time he's^ satis^fied 
Is ^when he's ^on a drunk^ ^

He'd ^fill his ^glasses up ^to the ^brim 
And he'll ^pass the ^cards around^
And the ^only ^pleasure he ^gets out of ^life 
Is ^ramblin' from ^town to ^town ^

Oh ^tell my ^baby ^sister ^
Not to ^do what ^I have ^done 
But ^shun that ^house in ^New Or^leans 
They ^call the ^Rising Sun^ ^

Well it's ^one foot ^on the pla^tform ^
And the ^other foot ^on the train^
I'm ^goin' ^back to ^New Orleans^
To ^wear that ^ball and cha^in ^

I'm a-^goin' ^back to ^New Orlea^ns 
My ^race is ^almost ^run 
I'm ^goin' ^back to ^end my li^fe 
^Down in the ^Rising Sun^ ^

There ^is a ^house in ^New Orlea^ns 
They ^call the ^Rising ^Sun 
It's ^been the ^ruin of ^many poor ^girl 
And ^me, oh ^god, I'm o^ne ^
