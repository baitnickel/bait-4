.intro Ebm D Db Bbm Ebm D Em A
If I ^fell in love with you would you ^promise to be true
And ^help me--^understand 
'Cause I've ^been in love before and I ^found that love was more
Than ^just holding ^hands 

.v1 D Em F#m Em A D Em F#m Em A D Gm A
If I ^give ^my ^heart to ^you, I ^must be sure
From the ^ve^ry ^start that ^you 
Would ^love me more than ^her   ^ ^

.v2 D Em F#m Em A D Em F#m Em A D9
If I ^trust ^in ^you, oh ^please 
Don't ^run and hide
If I ^love ^you ^too, oh ^please 
Don't ^hurt my pride like ^her 

.bridge G Gm D A
'Cause I couldn't stand the ^pain, and ^I 
Would be sad if our new ^love was in ^vain 

.v3 D Em F#m Em A D Em F#m Em A D9 D
So I ^hope ^you ^see that ^I would ^love to love you
^And ^that ^she will ^cry 
When ^she learns we are ^two   (second time: ... we are ^two)

.out Gm D Gm D
If I ^fell in love with ^you   ^ ^
