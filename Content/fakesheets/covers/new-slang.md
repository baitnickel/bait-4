^Gold teeth and a ^curse for this ^town were ^all in my ^mouth
Only ^I don't know ^how they got ^out, ^dear
^Turn me back ^into the ^pet I ^was when we ^met
I was ^happier ^then with no ^mind^set

  And if you'd 'a ^took to ^me like a ^ gull ^takes to the ^wind
  Well, I'd 'a ^jumped from ^my tree
  And ^I'd 'a ^danced like the ^king of the ^eyesores
  And the ^rest of our ^lives would 'a ^fared well

^New slang when you ^notice the ^stripes, the ^dirt in your ^fries
Hope it's ^right when you ^die, old and ^bo^ny
^Dawn breaks like a ^bull through the ^hall
^Never should have ^called
But my ^heads to the ^wall and I'm ^lone^ly

  (Chorus)

^God speed all the ^bakers at ^dawn may they ^all cut their ^thumbs
And bleed ^into the ^buns 'till they ^melt a^way

  I'm looking ^in on the ^good life I might be ^ doomed ^never to ^find
  Without a ^trust or flaming ^ fields, am I ^ too ^dumb to ^refine?
  And if you'd 'a ^took to ^me like
  Well ^ I'd a ^danced like the ^queen of the e^yesores
  And the ^rest of our ^lives would 'a ^fared well
