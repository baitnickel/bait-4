^ Once I had a ^dream, that ^worried me ^
Like a drunken ^guillo^tine 
^Linger^ing ^just a^bove my ^head 
^Why, wh^y, wh^y, wh^y?
^Why was ^I ^born "The ^Nine"
^Cursed re^peatedly ^
^Who would ^know if ^I should ^die,
^No one ^needed me ^

^Dar^k and ^empty was the ^place to which I’d ^come 
^Col^d and ^silent was the ^house my name was ^on 
^N^ ^ine ro^oms ^ and a ^tomb in ^every ^one 
S’^dar^k and ^empty was the ^place to which I’d ^come

^ All at once my ^bones be^gan to change ^
I was tall and ^young a^gain,
^Sweet as ^rain ^falling ^on the ^snow 
^Who, wh^o, wh^o, wh^o?
^Who is ^he, ^who am ^I
^What laid ^in-between? ^
^How can ^I ^say good^bye?
^No one ^let me in ^

^ Can’t see no ^need for ^Nine any^more 
^ Now it’s too ^late to ^o^pen the ^door^
