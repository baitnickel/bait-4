.v G C D G C D G C G
If the ^rain comes, they ^run and ^hide their ^heads 
They ^might as ^well be ^dead 
If the ^rain comes, if the ^rain comes

When the ^sun shines, they ^slip in^to the ^shade 
And ^sip their ^lemon^ade 
When the ^sun shines, when the ^sun shines

.c G* C* G G* C* G
^Rain .^.. I don't ^mind, ^Shine .^.. the weather's ^fine 

.v
I can ^show you that ^when it ^starts to ^rain 
^Every^thing's the ^same 
I can ^show you, I can ^show you

Can you ^hear me, that ^when it ^rains and ^shines 
It's ^just a ^state of ^mind?
Can you ^hear me? Can you ^hear me?
