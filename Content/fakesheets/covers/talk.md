^ Someday I'll ^fix my shoes ^ for somebody ^ else to use
^ When I can ^touch their face ^ and stay ^in the same place
^ But I'm terri^fied I won't, ^ I was raised ^over the phone
^ Your word was a ^wave then, ^ endlessly ^ breaking

.v
^ I'm pretty ^busy, ^ so please for^give me
^ If I for^get to ^ not for^give you
^ The way that I ^see it ^ you're no longer ^needed 
^ If I'm not mis^taken, ^ your ship never ^came in, did it?

.v
^ But I will no longer ^grieve for you ^ when I have to ^see you
^ It's no use de^nyin' ^ you belong to the ^dyin'
^ And I couldn't ^care less, ^ life's just a ^real slow death
^ Yep, that's what ^I was taught, ^ Okay, so I ^care a lot
