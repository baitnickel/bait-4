   .ch C D G G/F# Em Am D G
   Oh Monte^rey, where I ^make my stay, if I ^live long e^nough to ^pay 
   Oh Monte^rey, ^where my heart ^lies 

.v1 G Am D Em7 Am G Am D Em7 Am G Am D Em7 Am C D G
^  Got my suitcase packed, ^  I'm running off some petrol gas
^  It only ^dawns and ^fogs the ^brain 
Left my soul behind with a ^lover, ^lookin' to buy a^nother  ^  ^
Plane tickets cost too^ much, ^  I just ^got my ^head and my thumb
^  Riding ^there from Mexi^co   (chorus)

.v2 G Am D Em7 Am G Am D Em7 Am G Am D Em7 Am D G
^  The radio ain't got nothing to ^say, just ^politics and ^ramble ramble ^  all ^day 
The amp is buzzing in the ^backseat of this truck
The ^cars are ^passing and they^ can't get e^nough
Oh the drivers go^ing slow
And ^I can't ^wait ^  to get ou^t of Mexi^co

   .ch2 C D G G/F# Em Am C D G
   Oh Monte^rey, where I ^make my stay, if I ^live long e^nough to ^pay 
   Oh Monte^rey  ^  ^  ^

.br Am C Dm7 C G
And I could ^pack up all my bags
And I could ^leave it all behind
For an^other to find me a^gain^   (chorus twice)
