.v Am E7! Am! Am7/G! D9! F! Am E7 Am
One is ^fine, they told me, one is fine
Two is too, too, many, too much of the ^time 
When you ^lose that fee^ling, when you ^start to fall^     // ^lose your bal^ance
One is ^fine, they ^told me, one is ^all 

No you ^don't need more, never mind
There's a point inside, you will ^find,
Where it ^comes tog^ether--singu^larity^
All is ^one in time^, they said to m^e

We are ^too, too many, too much of the time
We are too, too differently in^clined
It’s a ^kind of fee^ling neither ^high nor low^    // only ^few will know^
When the ^time is rig^ht, we will ^know            // When it comes in f^ocus, one’ll ^know
