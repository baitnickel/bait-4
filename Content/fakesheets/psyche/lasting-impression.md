..intro Asus2 Am7
Intro: ^ ^ ...

.v Am F E7 Am(sus2) Dm E7 Am(sus2)
On the ^edge of the ^water you've ^come to feed the bone^s 
The river is ^wide and the ^river water ma^ssive
The ^rings on the ^water re^flect upon the stone^s
And in the ^air they re^sound upon the pa^ssive

.bridge Dm E7 Am Am/G F E7 Am(sus2)
And ^when you a^wake the ^storm is ^coming ^harder 
You feel the walls shake ^ you fear the ^roof will fail
You find yourself...

.ch C G C F E7 Am C G Am E7 F E7 Am(sus2)
^Right back in the ^battle, out of your ^body and out of your ^mind 
But maybe that lasting im^pression's come on ^back, right in time
Come on ^back^ (right in time), come on ^back^ (right in time)
Maybe that ^lasting im^pression's come on ^back 

   (verse chords)

.bridge
Your ^hold starts to ^quake the ^line is ^getting ^tauter 
Soon it will break, ^ soon it will be^ free fall

.v
The ^river rushes ^through you, you ^stand and wade to ^shore 
Warm, as the ^sun begins to ^take back every ^bead 
And ^calmly you ^offer the ^traces in the ^pores 
"Take of me ^gently," to the ^brilliant light you ^plead 

.bridge
You ^keep what you ^need 
The ^storm is ^coming har^der, soon it will break ^
You know you ^must not fail
And so you go-- (chorus)
