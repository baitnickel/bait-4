^Matthew and Erin meet down on the end of the ^wharf 
The ^ocean is heavy and heaving, occasionally a ^seal shows itself
^Back through the boardwalk of ^lights and mechanical ^laughter 
^Crossing the train tracks ^high above the San Lo^renzo

"^I recall crossing these tracks before," Erin re^marks
^Stepping from tie to tie and looking down ^through them
^As she recounts her ad^venture, Matthew con^siders
^This is a turning point, the ^two of them walk into ^dark 

.br Bb D Bb D C G A A7
^ The night is ^warm summer air
^ Their bodies ^young and naive
^ The wind falls ^into the river
^Climbs a cliff and enters the alley where... ^

^Matthew and Erin are cutting a groove in their ^time 
^Newspaper pages bound through the streets in the ^push of the wind
In ^credible words he de^scribes to her where he is ^going 
In ^cautious repose she ac^cepts them and follows his ^stride
