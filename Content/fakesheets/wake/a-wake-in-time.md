^Everything’s changing, ^try as we may
^Nothing can keep this moment here from ^slipping away
^Caught in the spin we spin we are just ^tryin’ to stay ^(still)

	^Lost in your eyes, they’re all I can see, ^held in the shine they shine upon me
	^Riding the waves, adrift are we, ^only (ah, just) a wake in time   // ^Floating, a wake in time
	^True are the hearts that beat in one time, ^true are the steps with hands entwined
	^Two on a course as true as one mind, ^floating along are we   ^ // side by side are we

.v
^Tickle my fancy, ^take me away
^Carry me just as lightly as you ^carry your day
^Nobody ever shows me this ex^actly the way you ^do (chorus)

.v
^Let me go softly as ^night into day
^Parting is surely sorrow, sweet, do ^show me the way
^You be the sea to this little breeze, and ^I'll wave your way    ^
