.v1 D(sus2) G6
^ I knew the moment, the moment I looked at you
There was a path awaitin' just us two
There was course, a way around this ^zoo 

.v2 D(sus2) G6 Em A7
^ We cross our shadows, our shadows in the sun
We take the steps, we tread until we’re done
We find the light, we find the darkness ^too 
(We ^do…)  ^

	.ch Bmadd4 Bmadd4/A A Bmadd4 Bmadd4/A Em A7
	^Words get in our ^way, they cannot ^say it
	^Lookin' in your ^eyes I come to ^see it  ^

.v1
^ I snap a picture, put you in a frame
With every query the answers are the same
I roll the dice and the dots add up to ^two 

.v2
^ Coming together, hope we make it last
Don’t wanna lose it, in time we’re fallin' fast
Two in abandon, lettin' the winds go ^past 
(We ^do…)  ^

(repeat chorus and verse 1)
