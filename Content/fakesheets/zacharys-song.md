^Zachary you and me, we take a lo^ng walk
^Wandering through our dream, hanging to the ^sun ^stalk 
^Put our heads together to make a lo^ng thought
You and ^me, you and ^me   ^

^Maybe we'll find a stream where we can go ^fishin' 
^Cast a starlight's beam and catch all we're ^wishin'  ^
^  You go your way and I'll go mine, ^we will be together in ti^me
You and ^me

^Zachary you and me, we have a lo^ng talk
As ^far as the sun from the sea, near as the ^shadow ^balk 
^  You say your say and I'll say mine, ^we will be together in ki^nd 
You and ^me
