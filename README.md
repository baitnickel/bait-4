The `bait-4` site is an experiment, a prototype of a publishing system, stressing strict separation between code and content. Text content may be created in any good markdown editor (Visual Studio Code, Obsidian, &c.). Audio, Video, and Graphic content may be created in any good recording/composing applications (QuickTime, iMovie, Photos, SVG drawing apps, &c.). In theory, as long as the content is in a form that meets HTML rendering standards (txt, md, jpg, mpg, svg, &c. &c.), the system should be able to render it, using properties assigned to the content by the user to determine *how* it is rendered, *how* a collection is sorted and navigated, &c.

`bait-4` is, as the name suggests, the fourth iteration of my website experiments. I've been at it for a few years.
