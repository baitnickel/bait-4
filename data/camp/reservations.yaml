# Add one row for each campsite reservation.
#
# Rows can be added in any order, but by convention we are keeping reservations
# for the same year grouped together (with comments such as "# 2024" separating
# the years), and it can make maintenance easier if rows within each year are
# sorted by site and arrival date.

# Field Values:
# -------------
# site: campsite number (must include the "J" prefix for cabins)
# arrival: date in "YYYY-MM-DD" format
# reserved: number of nights reserved
# cancelled: number of nights cancelled (or 0 for none)
# purchaser: key from groups.yaml; may be followed by a slash and the actual
#    reservation group name
# occupants: key from groups.yaml representing the family group occupying
#    the site, followed by a slash and one or more free-form occupant names.
#    When the value of this field does not contain a slash, the whole value of
#    the field is for info only, e.g., "Chad & Jeremy", "MAIN SITE", "?", etc.

# Every field must have a value (cannot be left empty). Enter something like a question
# mark ("?") when the value is not known. Commas are not allowed in a field value;
# other special characters (e.g., "&", "+", ";" are OK).

### 12 and 43 were actually cancelled 3, not 4. Was 86 cancelled at all on the first week?
