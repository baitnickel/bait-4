^ ^ She curls ^her face up in the pillow so,
^ ^ Then turns ^her body to a plaintive cry.
^ ^ “Open ^the door and let me in”, is what her little Toonie ^begs.

^ ^ “I get ^the shudders from infinity,        // shivers?
^ ^ I wan^na feel all of your warmth inside,
^ ^ I wan^na turn into a puddle in the curl of your ^legs,” ... so she ^says.

^ ^ The star^light filters through the window shade,
^ ^ The mock^ingbird recites its morning tune,
^ ^ Each in ^its own way falling in the endless roll of ^time.    // rising and falling

.v2
^ ^ Toonie ^and Lolo in the morning light,
^ ^ Barely ^a worry, not a single care,
//  ^ ^ Tangled ^together in the moment, in a harmony of ^rhyme,
^ ^ Tangled ^together in the moment, in a meeting of the minds ... // (of one ^kind).
