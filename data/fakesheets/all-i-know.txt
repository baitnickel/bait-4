.v1 Am E Dm Am
^taking the trail that winds high on the ridge o'er the riverbed
//^taking the trail 'long the contours of cliff over riverbed
//^taking the trail winding high on the cliff o're the creek bed
//^taking the trail skirting the edge of the cliff o're the riverbed
//^taking the trail that skims along the cliff of the riverbed // encroaches the slope
//^taking the trail where we follow the cliff o'er the riverbed
making our way in the quiet that opens an empty head
^passing the time as if all of our time isn’t ^up ahead
just for the ^sake of it

.v2 Am E Dm Am E Asus2
^you turn to me, in your eyes I can see you are here and how!
taking the trail as if swallowing whole every turn and brow
^passing the time as if all of our time isn’t ^here and now
one ^moment, sus^pended.  ^

	.c E E7 Am E E7 Am A A7 Dm Fmaj7b5 E
	^I was my ^own worst ^enemy
	^I was a ^conquered ^foe
	^I was a ^fool in ^many ways
	that’s ^all I ^know now

.v1
^crossing the bridge we are caught in the middle, the middle way
in between words we can hear all the things that we didn’t say
^shadow and silence surround us, it’s all in the ^interplay
we two are ^makin’ it

.v2
^you turn to me, in your eyes I can see you are here and how!
taking the trail as if swallowing whole every turn and brow
^passing the time as if all of our time isn’t ^here and now
one ^moment, sus^pended.  ^
