^Danny was up at Eight. He had a ^meeting with destiny.
He ^threw in a pear and a plum--a little ^psyche odyssey.

The ^earth, it comes around him, with the ^pedal to the floor.
What^ever the price of freedom, he wants more^.

^Santa Barbara's a proper town. Oh, she is ^very proud, indeed!
She ^wears a pretty face for the ^outside world to see.

And ^Danny was there when the sun went down. ^Lamps on the harbor punch the dark.
^Plenty of folks in top hats, no place to ^park.

^High above the roadside--"Rooms ^Twenty-Four a Night".
He ^doesn't think he can spare it, and it's only ^six hours through the night.

But the ^moon has been displaced. The ^stars are far and few.
There's ^nothing but this highway coming through^--nothing at all.

^Danny was up at Eight, and he ^stayed awake till Twelve,
^feeling his way back home, whole and well^.
