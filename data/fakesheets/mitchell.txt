^ We drove down to ^Mitchell, the sky was all ^clouds
The ocean was ^laughing, the land was so ^proud
^ The farmhousesâ€™ ^angles,^ the fences long ^lines
^ We drove down to ^Mitchell, with you on my ^mind

^ You gave me a ^picture, you drew me a ^scene
You set me in ^motion, goodbye what has ^been
^ You told me a ^story,^ and if visions don't ^lie
^ You made my ma^sk, and opened its ^eye

^ I called out to ^Annabelle, my faith was so ^strong
I knew I'd be ^waiting, but I knew not how ^long
^ The others en^gulfed her,^ concealed her re^ply
^ And set to con^vince me, they'd left her to ^die

^ I know now my ^Annabelle, remains to this ^day
Like the pressure of the se^eds in soil, like kernels in the ^clay
^ Arriving in ^Mitchell,^ we step from the ^car
^ We enter the ^paintings, each where we ^are
