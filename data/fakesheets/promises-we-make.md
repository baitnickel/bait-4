^Went on a journey, took a ride today, a^long with a friend o’ ^mine
^Crossed a bridge into the light o’ day, ^rollin’ thru the summer^time.
^Seeking ^something at the ^end of the ^way... Un^winding a tangled up ^mind......
^I took a journey of my ^own today, a^long with a friend o’ ^mine......  ^

.v
I ^hate to say it ‘cause it’s sad to say, we ^live in a very strange ^time.
The ^clouds are parting and the sky is grey, the ^blue has lost its ^shine
^Every ^little ^cloud it ^seems... leaves ^nothing of itself be^hind......
    // ^Bound by tomorrow and ^yesterday, we ^live in a very strange ^time.
^Betwixt tomorrow and ^yesterday, we ^live in a very strange ^time.

    //     ^Oh, will/may the ^sorrows of the ^past fade a^way?
    //     ^Oh, will/may the ^promises we ^make (...) ever see the light of ^day? ........ ^
    ^Oh, will the ^sorrows of the ^past fade a^way?
    //     ^Oh, will the ^promises we ^make (... ever) turn the night to ^day? ........ ^
    ^Oh, will the ^promises we ^make (... ever) see the light of ^day? ........ ^

    (verse instrumental)

.v
    // ^Met on the river ‘cross/thru the rocks today, where ^windy trails un^wind.
^Met on the river ‘long the rocks today, where ^windy trails un^wind.
^Held some people in my arms today, it’d ^been a mighty long ^time.
^Eye to ^eye nothin’ we ^had to ^say... the ^beating of our hearts was just ^fine......
^Met in the river on a ^rock today, where ^windy trails un^wind.
