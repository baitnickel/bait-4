.v G C G F C D G D G C G F C D G
You know she ^left me last ^night, and she may ^never re^turn
And if she ^don't, it ^seems to serve me ^right
But ^if she ^ever comes ^home, you know I'll ^treat her just like a ^queen
Because I ^don't think I could ^live through this a^gain


  .bridge C D G F C D(sus2) C D F Bb G C D(sus2)
  ^My oh ^my! ^  People told me how ^bad it was to be ^lonely  ^
  ^Now I ^see, ^  I shouldn't have ^laughed at them, ^  they weren't joking at ^all  ^

  (instrumental verse)

  .bridge
  ^My oh ^my! ^  People trying to ^help me just make me ^sadder  ^
  ^I can't ^find ^  any ^kind of cure ^  for the pain I ^feel ^

  (repeat first verse)
